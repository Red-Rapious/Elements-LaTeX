## Preview
This is the current interface of Elements LaTeX, currently in active development:

## Using Elements LaTeX on macOS
Simply download [the latest release](https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Elements-LaTeX/releases) and install it. MacOS will probably block the app opening because "the developper isn't identified". Until I sign the application with an Apple Developper Account, you can work around by clicking Show in Finder and `Ctrl + click` on the app icon.

To compile a document, you'll need to have a LaTeX installation. You can download it [on the official website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/), but you can use any other LaTeX installation as long as the `pdflatex` command is available.

## Building the project from source
Start by [installing `Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and `git` if not already done. Type the following commands to clone the `Elements-LaTeX` repository and install the dependencies:

```
mkdir elements-latex
cd elements-latex
git clone https://github.com/Red-Rapious/Elements-LaTeX
npm install electron -D

npm install electron-settings -D
npm install fix-path@v3.0.0 -D
npm install electron-context-menu -D
```

> Note: this library might be included as a submodule in the future (or using the `electron-pdf-viewer` node package), but you'll need to install it by yourself to build the project in it's current state.

To do so, download the `PDF.js` library [here](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases/download/v2.14.305/pdfjs-2.14.305-dist.zip), and add the extracted `pdfjs` folder in `elements-latex/src/libs`.

The final project structure should look as follows:

```
elements-latex
│   README.md
│   ...   
└─── assets
└─── src
|    └─── libs
|    │   └─── pdfjs
|    │       └─── build
|    |       └─── web
|    │   └─── code-input (submodule)
|    │   └─── ... (other submodules)
└─── node_modules
└─── ...
```

Then, to start the project, type:

```
npm start
```

> Note: working with `.tex` files contained in the `elements-latex` folder is not recommended, and can cause diverse issues.

If you want to build the project, you can lauch:

```
npm run build
```

> Note: this `npm` script uses the `electron-builder` package to build the project: you can install it by launching `npm install electron-builder -D`.
